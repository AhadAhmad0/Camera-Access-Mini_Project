ðŸ§  About OpenCV (cv2):
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It contains over 2,500 optimized algorithms for real-time image processing and computer vision tasks. The cv2 module is the Python interface to OpenCV and is widely used in image and video capture, object detection, and face recognition.

In this mini-project, cv2 is used to:
1. Initialize and control the webcam

2. Closing the webcam
